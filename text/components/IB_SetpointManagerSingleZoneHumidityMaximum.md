## IB_SetpointManagerSingleZoneHumidityMaximum

![](../../images/components/IB_SetpointManagerSingleZoneHumidityMaximum.png)


The Single Zone Maximum Humidity Setpoint Manager allows the control of a single zone maximum humidity level. This setpoint manager, used in conjunction with object {ZoneControl:Humidistat}, detects the air humidity level in a single control zone and uses air/moisture mass balances to calculate the supply air humidity ratio needed to maintain the zone relative humidity at or below a given setpoint. The calculated supply air humidity ratio is then used as the setpoint for the designated setpoint node. A dehumidification component placed upstream of this node can then use the humidity ratio setpoint to control its moisture removal rate (e.g., desiccant dehumidifiers). In the case of a chilled water coil which is used for both temperature and high humidity control, this setpoint manager works in conjunction with a {Controller:WaterCoil} object to determine the minimum supply air temperature required to meet both the temperature (sensible) and humidity (latent) load in the control zone.

#### Inputs
* ##### Ctrlzone [Required]
The name of the zone air node for the humidity control zone (as specified in the object {ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections}). An example of this object in an input data file (IDF), along with a temperature set point manager, humidistat, and a simple controller, is shown below: SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum, Zone Max Set Point Manager,           !- Name VAV Sys 1 Outlet Node,                !- Setpoint Node or NodeList Name Zone 2 Node;                          !-Control Zone Air Node Name SetpointManager:Scheduled, Scheduled Set Point Manager 1,        !- Name Temperature,                          !- Control Variable Seasonal Reset Supply Air Temp Sch,   !- Schedule Name VAV Sys 1 Outlet Node;                !- Setpoint Node or NodeList Name ZoneControl:Humidistat, Zone 2 Humidistat,                    !-Name ZONE 2,                               !- Zone Name Min rel Hum Set Sch2;                 !- Humidifying Relative Humidity Setpoint Schedule Name Controller:WaterCoil, Central Cooling Coil Controller 1,    !- Name TEMPandHUMRAT,                        !- Control Variable Reverse,                              !- Action FLOW,                                 !- Actuator Variable VAV Sys 1 Outlet Node,                !- Sensor Node Name Main Cooling Coil 1 Water Inlet Node, !- Actuator Node Name 0.002,                                !- Controller Convergence Tolerance deltaC 0.025,                                !- Maximum Actuated Flow {m3/s} 0.0;                                  !- Minimum Actuated Flow {m3/s}
