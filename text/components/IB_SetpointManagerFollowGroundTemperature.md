## IB_SetpointManagerFollowGroundTemperature

![](../../images/components/IB_SetpointManagerFollowGroundTemperature.png)


This setpoint manager is used to place a temperature setpoint on a system node that is derived from a current ground temperature. The ground temperatures are specified in different Site:GroundTemperature:* objects and used during the simulation. This setpoint manager is primarily intended for condenser or plant loops using some type of ground heat exchanger.  Above content copyright © 1996-2025 EnergyPlus, all contributors.
